# Redactable-blockchain
Redactable blockchain based on lattice and HIBCH implementations

The project builds an redactable blockchain project using the Hyperledger Fabric platform. This editable feature is achieved by replacing the original SHA256 algorithm with a lattice-based chameleon hash function.
We are in the process of organizing the project code and waiting for it to be uploaded.We will provide it later and hope that all scholars will give their valuable comments and make progress together.
